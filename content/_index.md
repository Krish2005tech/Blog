Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I’ll be sharing:

- 🌱 Personal updates & learnings  
- ⚙️ Behind-the-scenes developer thoughts  
- 💡 Things I’m building  
- 🧠 Tech notes & experiments  

This blog is meant to be simple, honest, and fun — just me writing about things I enjoy or struggle through as a developer.

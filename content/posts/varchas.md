## A Year in Retrospect

Okay, so today I’m writing about something **other than tech**.

As this year comes to an end, I found myself looking back at everything that happened in my life over the past year. And honestly, I can say it was an overall **good experience**. I learned a lot, developed new skills, and started understanding human psychology a little better mostly through real-life experiences. I made new friends, reconnected with some old ones, and maybe even made a few *anti-friends* along the way.

## Discovering Varchas

Among all these moments, one experience from the previous semester stands out the most : **Varchas**.

Varchas is the annual sports fest of my institute. Over the years, due to various reasons especially the people involved at the top student-management level it had developed a somewhat negative association with its name. Add to that the fact that we’re a technical institute, where the number of people who genuinely care about sports is relatively small.

One of those few people is my dear friend **[Sudhanshu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudhanshu-tamhankar-b9a662280/)**, who also happens to be the Vice President of the Board of Student Sports at our institute. He asked me to be a part of this year’s **edition** of Varchas: *Varchas 2025*  as a **Festival Chief**.

## Becoming a Festival Chief

Among all student-organising bodies in our institute, the hierarchy usually goes like this:

**Festival Chief → Heads → Assistant Heads → Volunteers**

Me becoming an FC (as we call it) of one of the three major fests of my institute was something I had never even imagined.

Initially, I was very skeptical mainly because of Varchas’ past history and my other commitments. This conversation happened around the first or second week of September, just before my minor exams and interviews just after, which made the decision even tougher.

## The Team That Made It Possible

What truly convinced me were my **co-FCs** and the sheer dedication I saw in Sudhanshu.

Our General Secretary of the Student Activity Council under whom Varchas operates helped us at every step. It was the first time for all of us to handle something of this scale: **700+ participants from all over India** coming to our institute. His experience and consistent guidance helped us push ourselves to our full potential.

This was **not an easy journey**.

Almost everyone was scared because of Varchas’ history and reluctant to get their hands “dirty.” Only we know how difficult it was to build a reliable team, starting with around **40ish heads** whom we could trust to independently handle their verticals. Being human, we didn’t get everything right. We had to let go of some heads who didn’t align with our goal of successfully executing the fest.

After that came the challenge of forming a working team of Assistant Heads and volunteers another uphill task. But slowly and steadily, we built a team that was ready to take on the challenge.

## My Role:

There were **four Festival Chiefs**, with Sudhanshu acting as the **ex-officio**, overseeing and supporting all of us. To manage things better, we divided the verticals among ourselves.

I was given **Finance**, which mainly involved accounting purchases and expenditures, permissions, office paperwork, and approvals. Most of the time it went well, though there were definitely moments where I questioned myself and thought, *“Why did I take this up?”*

## Two Months That Flew By

Varchas was a journey of **immense planning**. We were practically building the fest from the ground up. Every day brought something new, a new procedure, a new requirement, or a new problem to solve. I made it a point to document everything in a common Google Drive for future reference.

Those two months from mid-September to **7–9 November** vanished unbelievably fast. I was constantly juggling lectures, office work, team meetings, and running around campus getting signatures on paperwork. There were many sleepless nights. Sometimes, I wouldn’t see friends who lived just next door in the hostel for weeks.

It was also the first time I gave **quizzes with barely 30 minutes of preparation**, literally reading the text for the first time while walking to the exam hall.

Friends stepped up in ways that meant a lot like my teammate in a humanities project who practically handled everything on his own after seeing my involvement in Varchas, and didn’t hold any resentment even when we didn’t score very well due to my negligible contribution. These small gestures mattered more than people realize.

## Was It Worth It?

Absolutely.

Seeing the fest unfold beautifully, watching weeks of planning actually work that feeling was unreal. It wasn’t perfect. There were hiccups. We made mistakes, forgot to send a few mails, and maybe strained some relationships.

But what I choose to embrace is the **journey** and the deep bond I formed with my co-FCs.

We knew each other before, but never like this. We were there for each other at our breaking points, gave each other strength, and carried both ourselves and Varchas together till the very end, especially that moment of peace after the **musical night**, which officially marked the successful conclusion of Varchas.

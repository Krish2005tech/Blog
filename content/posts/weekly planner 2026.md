It’s that time of the year again.  
New Year, new resolutions, and the same old cycle  we talk about how badly we failed last year, promise ourselves that *this year will be different*, and then somehow end up repeating the pattern.

I’m talking about this because I also did something very *New Year-ish*: I made a **weekly planner** for the time I’ll be on campus.  
But before it sounds like another productivity stunt, I want to say one thing in my defence.

This planner is **not** a system to force myself to do things.  
It’s a system to help me do the things I already do **more responsibly and consciously**.

There are no ridiculous targets here.  
No “20 DSA questions every day”, no “100-day GitHub streak”, no fictional discipline arc.  
Just something simple, realistic, and human.

## Why I Even Made This Planner

The goal is not to magically become productive overnight.  
The goal is to **record what I’ve done**, plan **small manageable steps**, and avoid the mental chaos of figuring everything out every single day.

I’ve planned this in **weekly chunks**, because thinking too far ahead usually breaks down anyway.

The sheet is divided into **17 weeks**, starting from **5th January**, which is when I’ll be back on campus.

## Structure of the Planner

Each day has the following headers:

```

Date | Day | Task | Details | Status | Walk | WhatsApp Blog | Hugo Blog

```

Some of these are obvious, but I’ll still explain how I’m thinking about each one.

---

## Task Categories (The Core of the System)

Instead of writing vague tasks, I’ve defined **clear categories**.  
This reduces decision fatigue and keeps expectations realistic.

### 1. Acads  
I’m a **3rd-year CSE student**, so academics can’t be optional.  
Assignments, course projects, labs, exam prep  all of that goes here.

Keeping a dedicated academic day each week feels reasonable instead of trying to squeeze it everywhere.

---

### 2. Mini Projects  
These are **small, quick side projects**.

Mostly things I build and deploy on my website  
(you can check them out at **links.krish2005.tech**).

The purpose here is:
- Revising coding concepts
- Experimenting with ideas
- Building tools that make my own life a little easier

No pressure, no perfection  just learning by building.

---

### 3. Big Project  
This is for **one meaningful, long-term project** at a time.

Something that usually takes **weeks of consistent effort**, not something you finish in a weekend.  
If I make a meaningful contribution on a day, it counts.

---

### 4. Certifications  
These are the extra courses I do to **upskill myself** outside regular coursework.

Instead of randomly starting things and never finishing them, this helps me consciously decide:
- What to learn
- When to learn it
- How much time it deserves

---

### 5. Exam  
This is strictly for **minor and major exams**.

I already know that during exams, expecting myself to do anything else is unrealistic.  
So instead of pretending, I acknowledge it.

---

## The Three Most Important Day Types

These are the days that make the whole system *human* instead of robotic.

### 1. Free Day  
I’m still a small human child on the inside.

I can’t do productive work endlessly without breaking down, so I’ve intentionally added a **free day** every week.

This could mean:
- Watching random shorts
- Doing nothing
- Spending time on hobbies
- Sleeping guilt-free

No justification required.

---

### 2. Buffer Day  
I’m not perfect, and plans fail.

A buffer day exists to:
- Finish incomplete tasks
- Handle unexpected work
- Do something off-plan without stress

This single decision removes a lot of anxiety.

---

### 3. Planning Day (The Most Important One)  
This is the backbone of the whole system.

A dedicated day to:
- Reflect on the previous week
- Decide priorities for the next one
- Choose which certification to pursue
- Assign days based on workload and commitments

I’ve given planning its **own full day** because half-baked planning usually leads to half-baked execution.

---

## The Supporting Columns

### Details  
A short explanation of **what exactly I plan to do** that day.

This prevents vague tasks like “work on project” from lying to me.

---

### Status  
Simple and honest:
- Not done  
- Partial  
- Done  

No shame attached.

---

### Walk  
A daily plan for a **1-hour walk around the berms** on campus.

Purely for:
- Off-screen time
- Mental clarity
- Basic fitness

No tracking obsession  just intention.

---

### Hugo Blog  
These are my **devlogs**.

A devlog is essentially a record of:
- What I built
- What I learned
- Why I made certain decisions

This blog itself is an example of that documenting *how* I plan things, not just what I build.

---

### WhatsApp Blog  
These are much more informal.

Small reflections from my day thoughts or moments that were meaningful to me, but not polished or technical enough to become devlogs.

Personal, raw, and low-effort.

---

## Final Thoughts

This planner isn’t about becoming a productivity machine.  
It’s about **being intentional without being cruel to myself**.

If it works  great.  
If it doesn’t  I’ll change it.

For now, this is just my attempt to enter the new year **with awareness instead of pressure**.

Let’s see how it goes.
Happy New Year, everyone!

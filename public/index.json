Not a fancy platform, not something overloaded with features — just a clean space where I could write my way, at my pace.\nAnd today… you\u0026rsquo;re reading this on blog.krish2005.tech — my new home on the web.\nThis is the story of how it came together.\n🧠 My Mindset: Keep It Simple, But Developer-Friendly I knew I wanted a few things right from the start:\nMinimal setup — because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend weeks installing plugins. Fast \u0026amp; lightweight — no bloat, no unnecessary JS. Markdown-based — writing should feel natural. Free hosting — because why pay for something simple? Customizable later as I grow — I\u0026rsquo;m a developer; I will tweak things. Basically:\nI wanted something like Medium\u0026rsquo;s simplicity, but with GitHub-level control.\n🔍 Options I Considered Before jumping in, I looked at several options:\n1. Write.as / BearBlog They were beautifully minimal — but I eventually realized I\u0026rsquo;d want more customization.\n2. Substack / Medium Great writing experience, but:\nNo full control No real customization Poor for dev-heavy posts Hard to design my own structure later 3. Blogger / WordPress.com These felt too old-school or too bloated.\n4. Static site generators like: Hugo Jekyll Astro 11ty These gave full control but required some setup — still worth it.\n🚀 Why I Chose Hugo + Cloudflare Pages This stack won for a few reasons:\n✔ Crazy fast builds (Hugo compiles instantly) ✔ Markdown content ✔ Free static hosting with Cloudflare Pages ✔ Automatic HTTPS ✔ Git-based workflow ✔ Easy custom domain ✔ Future customization is limitless And the PaperMod theme made the whole site look clean and modern with almost zero effort.\nSo the decision was made:\nHugo for content → Cloudflare Pages for hosting.\n🧱 The Actual Steps I Took (So You Can Do It Too) Here\u0026rsquo;s exactly how I did it:\n1. Install Hugo On Windows:\nchoco install hugo Check:\nhugo version 2. Create a new Hugo site hugo new site Blog cd Blog 3. Add PaperMod theme git init git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod Edit hugo.toml to include:\ntheme = \u0026#34;PaperMod\u0026#34; 4. Create first pages Homepage content, About page, and first post.\nExample:\nhugo new posts/hello-world.md I edited them later to add proper text.\n5. Preview locally hugo server -D This was the moment where I finally saw my site.\n6. Push to GitHub git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit\u0026#34; git branch -M main git remote add origin \u0026lt;repo-url\u0026gt; git push -u origin main 7. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages This part was trickier.\nAt first, I accidentally created a Worker instead of a Pages project This resulted in Cloudflare ignoring Hugo entirely and showing only:\nHello world And later a 404 page.\nI spent time debugging it until I realized:\n👉 I must use Pages, not Workers.\nSo I deleted the Worker and created a Pages → Connect to Git project.\nInside Cloudflare Pages, I set:\nBuild command: hugo Output directory: public Env variable: HUGO_VERSION = 0.152.2 Then Cloudflare finally ran a real build.\n8. Connecting my .tech domain When my domain became available, I added:\nblog.krish2005.tech Cloudflare automatically configured DNS and HTTPS.\nSeeing my site live on a real domain was so satisfying.\n🧩 Problems I Faced \u0026amp; How I Solved Them ❌ Problem 1 — Cloudflare kept showing \u0026ldquo;Hello world\u0026rdquo; This was because it was deploying as a Worker, not a Page.\nFix: Delete Worker → Create Pages project.\n❌ Problem 2 — 404 after deployment This happened because Cloudflare deployed 0 files.\nFix: Ensure output directory = public And Hugo actually builds properly.\n❌ Problem 3 — Couldn\u0026rsquo;t change .pages.dev URL Turns out: Page subdomains are fixed. Solution: use my custom .tech domain instead.\n🎉 What I Learned Static site generators are powerful once you get past the initial setup. Cloudflare Pages is one of the best free dev tools available today. A blog doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be perfect — it just needs to exist. Writing is easier when you own your space. 🌱 What\u0026rsquo;s next? I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing about:\nThings I learn Projects I build Tech experiments Mistakes \u0026amp; debugging stories Personal growth This blog is not just a website — it\u0026rsquo;s a timeline of me becoming a better developer.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve read this far: Thanks for joining me on day one.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-i-set-up-this-blog/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFor a long time, I wanted a simple place on the internet where I could write about tech, document small wins, share problems I solve, or even drop personal thoughts.
